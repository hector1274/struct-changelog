## 📚 How It Works

struct-changelog works by comparing previous versions of your data with the current version. When you input your nested structure, it analyzes the data and provides a clear output of the differences. This makes it easy to understand how your data evolves over time.

## 📝 Example Usage

Let’s say you have a nested dictionary representing user data. By using struct-changelog, you can input this dictionary, make changes, and then track those changes seamlessly.

### Input Example:
```python
user_data = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'address': {
        'city': 'New York',
        'zip': '10001'
    }
}
```

### Change Tracking:
After updating the user’s address, you simply run struct-changelog again, and it will highlight the differences in your nested structure.
